  <h2>Don't Starve Calendar</h2>
  <p id="note">Please note that the values used to calculate seasons are based on the default game settings. However, these figures are not always reliable due to an occasional <a href="https://dontstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Seasons/World">rounding error with the Don't Starve game</a> itself sometimes adding 1-2 days per year. This means the longer your game save has been going, the more likely you are to see discrepancies between your game and this page.</p>
